      D       G        D        A
      Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee,
      D       G        A        D
      Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
      D       G        D        A
      Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
      D       G        A        D
      Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

      Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee,
      D       G        A        D
      Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
      D       G        D        A
      Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
      D       G        A        D
      Perfect in power, in love, and purity.
