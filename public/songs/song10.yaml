      Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!

      Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
      G       C        G        D
      Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

      Perfect submission, perfect delight,
      G       C        G        D
      Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
      G       C        G        D
      Angels descending, bring from above
      G       C        G        D
      Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
