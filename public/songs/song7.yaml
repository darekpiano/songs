      G       C        G        D
      A mighty fortress is our God,
      G       C        G        D
      A bulwark never failing;
      G       C        G        D
      Our helper He, amid the flood
      G       C        G        D
      Of mortal ills prevailing.
      G       C        G        D
      For still our ancient foe
      G       C        G        D
      Doth seek to work us woe;
      G       C        G        D
      His craft and power are great,
      G       C        G        D
      And, armed with cruel hate,
      G       C        G        D
      On earth is not his equal.

      Did we in our own strength confide,
      G       C        G        D
      Our striving would be losing;
      G       C        G        D
      Were not the right Man on our side,
      G       C        G        D
      The Man of God's own choosing.
      G       C        G        D
      Dost ask who that may be?
      G       C        G        D
      Christ Jesus, it is He;
      G       C        G        D
      Lord Sabaoth is His name,
      G       C        G        D
      From age to age the same,
      G       C        G        D
      And He must win the battle.

      G       C        G        D
      And though this world, with devils filled,
      G       C        G        D
      Should threaten to undo us,
      G       C        G        D
      We will not fear, for God hath willed
      G       C        G        D
      His truth to triumph through us.
      G       C        G        D
      The Prince of Darkness grim,
      G       C        G        D
      We tremble not for him;
      G       C        G        D
      His rage we can endure,
      G       C        G        D
      For lo, his doom is sure;
      G       C        G        D
      One little word shall fell him.

      G       C        G        D
      That word above all earthly powers,
      G       C        G        D
      No thanks to them, abideth;
      G       C        G        D
      The Spirit and the gifts are ours
      G       C        G        D
      Through Him who with us sideth.
      G       C        G        D
      Let goods and kindred go,
      G       C        G        D
      This mortal life also;
      G       C        G        D
      The body they may kill:
      G       C        G        D
      God's truth abideth still;
      G       C        G        D
      His kingdom is forever.
