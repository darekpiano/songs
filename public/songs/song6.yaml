      G       C        G        D
      What a friend we have in Jesus,
      G       C        G        D
      All our sins and griefs to bear!
      G       C        G        D
      What a privilege to carry
      G       C        G        D
      Everything to God in prayer!
      G       C        G        D
      Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
      G       C        G        D
      Oh, what needless pain we bear,
      G       C        G        D
      All because we do not carry
      G       C        G        D
      Everything to God in prayer!

      G       C        G        D
      Have we trials and temptations?
      G       C        G        D
      Is there trouble anywhere?
      G       C        G        D
      We should never be discouraged,
      G       C        G        D
      Take it to the Lord in prayer.
      G       C        G        D
      Can we find a friend so faithful,
      G       C        G        D
      Who will all our sorrows share?
      G       C        G        D
      Jesus knows our every weakness,
      G       C        G        D
      Take it to the Lord in prayer.

      G       C        G        D
      Are we weak and heavy-laden,
      G       C        G        D
      Cumbered with a load of care?
      G       C        G        D
      Precious Savior, still our refuge,
      G       C        G        D
      Take it to the Lord in prayer.
      G       C        G        D
      Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
      G       C        G        D
      Take it to the Lord in prayer;
      G       C        G        D
      In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
      G       C        G        D
      Thou wilt find a solace there.
