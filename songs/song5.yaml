      G       C        G        D
      Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
      G       C        G        D
      There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
      G       C        G        D
      Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
      G       C        G        D
      As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.
