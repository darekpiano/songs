      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, without one plea,
      G       C        G        D
      But that Thy blood was shed for me,
      G       C        G        D
      And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, and waiting not
      G       C        G        D
      To rid my soul of one dark blot;
      G       C        G        D
      To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, though tossed about
      G       C        G        D
      With many a conflict, many a doubt,
      G       C        G        D
      Fightings and fears within, without,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
      G       C        G        D
      Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
      G       C        G        D
      Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
      G       C        G        D
      Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
      G       C        G        D
      Because Thy promise I believe,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

      G       C        G        D
      Just as I am, Thy love unknown
      G       C        G        D
      Hath broken every barrier down;
      G       C        G        D
      Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
      G       C        G        D
      O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
