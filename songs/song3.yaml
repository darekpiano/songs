      G       C        G        D
      When peace like a river attendeth my way,
      G       C        G        D
      When sorrows like sea billows roll;
      G       C        G        D
      Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
      G       C        G        D
      "It is well, it is well with my soul."

      Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
      G       C        G        D
      Let this blest assurance control,
      G       C        G        D
      That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
      G       C        G        D
      And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

      My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
      G       C        G        D
      My sin, not in part but the whole,
      G       C        G        D
      Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
      G       C        G        D
      Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

      And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
      G       C        G        D
      The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
      G       C        G        D
      The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
      G       C        G        D
      Even so, it is well with my soul.
