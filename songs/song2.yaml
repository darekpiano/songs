      G       C        G        D
      O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
      G       C        D        G
      Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
      G       C        G        D
      I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
      G       C        D        G
      Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

      G       C        G        D
      When through the woods and forest glades I wander
      G       C        D        G
      And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
      G       C        G        D
      When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
      G       C        D        G
      And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:

      G       C        G        D
      And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
      G       C        D        G
      Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
      G       C        G        D
      That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
      G       C        D        G
      He bled and died to take away my sin:

      When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
      G       C        D        G
      And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
      G       C        G        D
      Then I shall bow in humble adoration
      G       C        D        G
      And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
