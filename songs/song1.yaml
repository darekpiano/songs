      G                D             G        C
      Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
      G              Em            D        G
      That saved a wretch like me!
      G                D             G        C
      I once was lost, but now am found
      G              Em            D        G
      Was blind, but now I see.

      G                D             G        C
      'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
      G              Em            D        G
      And grace my fears relieved;
      G                D             G        C
      How precious did that grace appear
      G              Em            D        G
      The hour I first believed.

      G                D             G        C
      Through many dangers, toils and snares,
      G              Em            D        G
      I have already come;
      G                D             G        C
      'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
      G              Em            D        G
      And grace will lead me home.
